      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Give your pet the perfect blend of style, comfort and durability with
        our hand-crafted dog collars. Designed by me with functionality and
        enjoyment at the forefront of my mind, these collars feature hand-dyed
        Maple beads and military grade paracord with a 550lb tensile strength-
        enough for any adventure while staying lightweight and comfortable for
        movement and every day ware. The slip fit design makes Dogwood Collars
        easy to put on and take off, and they are fully leash-compatible for
        walks, training or playtime. The martingale feature of the collar allows
        it to fit loose and free like a necklace, but when engaged by a leash it
        cinches up just enough to lose the ability to move over the head. While
        there are standard sizes available (X-Small- Large), for custom orders
        it is important to measure your pets head to ensure a perfect fit. See
        our measurement guide tab prior to ordering.
